## Terminology

Here is a glossary of some of the terms that you will hear people mention pretty frequently, in conversations within the Ruby community, whose meanings might not be readily apparent. Some of these are non-technical terms that stand in for programming or development concepts, while others are pieces of technical jargon or specific Ruby or Rails designations.

 ==============================

<dl>

<dt><strong>BDD</strong></dt> 

<dd>Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><strong>DRY</strong></dt>

<dd>In software engineering, don't repeat yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development, a principle aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds, especially useful in multi-tier architectures. The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><strong>RESTful</strong></dt>

<dd>REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It uses the four HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to execute different operations.  A REST API is a set of operations that can be invoked by means of any the four verbs, using the actual URI as parameters for your operations.</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><strong>RTFM</strong></dt>

<dd>Literally "Read The F**king Manual"; a term showing the frustration of being bothered with questions so trivial that the asker could have quickly figured out the answer on their own with minimal effort, usually by reading readily-available documents.</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><strong>SaaS</strong></dt>

<dd> Short for "Software as a Service", SaaS is a software delivery method that provides access to software and its functions remotely as a Web-based service. </dd>

<p></p>

<dt><strong>SOAP</strong></dt>

<dd>Short for "Simple Object Access Protocol", a lightweight XML-based messaging protocol used to encode the information in Web service request and response messages before sending them over a network. SOAP messages are independent of any operating system or protocol and may be transported using a variety of Internet protocols, including SMTP, MIME, and HTTP.</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><strong>TDD</strong></dt>

<dd>Test-driven development (TDD), is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development, where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test, and refactoring.</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><strong>YAGNI</strong></dt>

<dd>"You aren't gonna need it" (acronym: YAGNI) is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.</dd>

<p></p>

<dt><strong>Yak-Shaving</strong></dt>

<dd>Any seemingly pointless activity which is actually necessary to solve a problem which solves a problem which, several levels of recursion later, solves the real problem you're working on.</dd>

</dl>
