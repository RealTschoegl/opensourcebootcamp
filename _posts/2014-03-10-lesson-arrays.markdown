## Review

Review from [Week 1 : Lesson 7 : Time]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-03-07-lesson-time %}).  One (or more) pair will rehash the previous session's lesson by teaching the basic learnings to the group.  They will explain it to the others by drawing a diagram, using an analogy, telling a story or in some other way creatively communicating the idea without using code.

## Arrays

### _What Is It?_

The most basic type of data storage.  It seems a little unsophisticated at first, but you'll be surprised what you can do with it.  

As an analogy, an array is a little like a backpack. You put things in one at a time.   Stuff on the bottom can only be found by remembering that its on the bottom.  Otherwise, you gotta root around.
