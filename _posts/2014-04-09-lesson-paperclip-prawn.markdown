## Review

Review from [Week 6 : Lesson 2 : State Machines]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-04-08-lesson-state-machine %}).  One (or more) pair will rehash the previous session's lesson by teaching the basic learnings to the group.  They will explain it to the others by drawing a diagram, using an analogy, telling a story or in some other way creatively communicating the idea without using code.
