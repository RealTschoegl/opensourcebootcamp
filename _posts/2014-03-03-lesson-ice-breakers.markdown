Welcome to the Open Source Bootcamp's inaugural Ruby on Rails Developer course!  Over the next twelve weeks you will be learning web development, computer programming, and product design.  By the end, you will be real, honest-to-goodness hackers.  But first, who are you?

## Getting Comfy

Get to know your week's pairing partner.  Each week you will be assigned a new pairing partner.  This decision will be made for you.  Just like in real life.

* Get into the pairs we just assigned you.
* Introduce yourself to your partner.  Ask them the following questions:
 * What was the best thing that happened to you this weekend?
 * Why do you live in the XXXXXX area?
 * Who do you admire the most?
 * What is your favorite quote?
 * What is your favorite animal? List three adjectives to explain your choice. 
 * Whatever else you want...
* Introduce the rest of the group to your partner.

### Robot Game
One partner pair comes up and plays the robot game.  How do you play the robot game?  Each pair is given a task to accomplish. One partner is the programmer and the other is the robot.  The programmer has to tell their partner exactly what to do.  The audience members (aka the rest of the group) will buzz loudly (LOUDLY!) if at any time the robot is getting too "interpretive".
