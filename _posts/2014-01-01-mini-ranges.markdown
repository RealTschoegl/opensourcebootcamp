In order to gain your very own **Teach One** badge, you will teach your fellow students how to use **Ranges in Ruby**. 

The lesson should last no longer that 15 minutes and include a live coding exercise.  The idea is not to become a subject matter expert in whatever you are teaching, but instead to introduce your fellow students and yourself to a useful technology.
