## Review

Review from [Week 2 : Lesson 5 : Debugging and Commenting]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-03-14-lesson-debugging %}).  One (or more) pair will rehash the previous session's lesson by teaching the basic learnings to the group.  They will explain it to the others by drawing a diagram, using an analogy, telling a story or in some other way creatively communicating the idea without using code.

## Testing

### _What Is It?_

One of the most commonly used phrases you are going to hear is TDD or Test-Driven Development.  The idea is that you first design a test for the piece of code you are going to write - then write only enough code to make sure that the test passes.

The idea is to make testing an integral part of your work-flow, to create code that will be more easily maintained, and to improve the quality of your code by never writing unneccessary code.  This makes for code that is good today and just as good tomorrow.

There are a number of different frameworks for testing - some of which we will get to later in this curriculum - but the one we are focusing on in this lesson is RSpec.

### _How Does It Work?_

RSpec is a gem that adds a variety of methods, objects, and other tools you can use to help test the code you have written.

* Show how/when to require it
* Show what a describe block is
* Demonstrate how to set an expectation
* Explain what matchers are and gives some examples
* Explain modifiers
* Explain how to test a predicate and what some predicates are
* Show how to mark a test as pending
* Show how to use implicit subjects 
* Show how to use implicit receivers
* Show how to nest examples
* Show how to use context
* Show how to use let with subjects
* Explain how to use hooks
* Explain how to use tags
* Show how to use shared examples
* Explain about filters
* Explain about metadata
* Explain what a stub is
* Explain what a mock is
* Show how and when to use stubs and mocks
* Explain how to mock and stub using params
* Show how to use mocks and stubs with returns 
* Explain how to make custom matchers

### _What Can I Do With It?_

### _Why Do I Care?_

So it works. For now.  Bwahaha.
