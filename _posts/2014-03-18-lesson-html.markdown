## Review

Review from [Week 3 : Lesson 1 : Testing]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-03-17-lesson-testing %}).  One (or more) pair will rehash the previous session's lesson by teaching the basic learnings to the group.  They will explain it to the others by drawing a diagram, using an analogy, telling a story or in some other way creatively communicating the idea without using code.

## HTML

### _What Is It?_

HTML is not a programming language.  Repeat after me: HTML is not a programming language.  HTML is a markup language: it's job is just to tell the browser what to put where.  

Think of the browser as a bunch of movers and HTML is the nervous homeowner telling them where to put the sofa.  You can tell them to put it here or there, but you can't tell them to make a sofa - that's not what they do.
