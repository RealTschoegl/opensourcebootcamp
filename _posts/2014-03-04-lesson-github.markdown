## Review

Review from [Week 1 : Lesson 2 : The Terminal]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-03-03-lesson-the-terminal %}).  One (or more) pair will rehash the previous session's lesson by teaching the basic learnings to the group.  They will explain it to the others by drawing a diagram, using an analogy, telling a story or in some other way creatively communicating the idea without using code.

## Github

### _What Is It?_

Designed to help developers work together on open-source projects, Github has become the place where coders put their stuff. Although it can serve as a library, the real heart of the thing is as a way for multiple programmers to be able to work together without breaking their programs.  

Sometimes you will hear Github described as a VCS or Version Control System.  The biggest problem with having multiple coders working on a project is that they all making changes to a code base that is itself changing.  These shifting sands would be impossible to navigate unless there was a way to stop that at certain points and get everyone on the same page. 

So this is the best way to understand how the process flow works.
