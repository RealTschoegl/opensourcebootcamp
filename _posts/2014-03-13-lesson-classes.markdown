## Review

Review from [Week 2 : Lesson 3 : Hashes]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-03-12-lesson-hashes %}).  One (or more) pair will rehash the previous session's lesson by teaching the basic learnings to the group.  They will explain it to the others by drawing a diagram, using an analogy, telling a story or in some other way creatively communicating the idea without using code.

## Classes and inheritance

### _What Is It?_

Everything in Ruby is an object, right?  Well some objects are different than other objects in that they belong to a specific class.

### _How Does It Work?_

So everything in Ruby is an object.  But that is a bit like everything is a thing. Some are more similar to one type of thing than another.

* Explain what some of the fundamental classes are in Ruby
* Show the different ways to create a class
* Show how one child class of object can inherit attributes from a parent class of object
* Show how one child class can override the parent class's attributes
* Show how to get class methods
* Show how to identify the class
* Show how to initialize a class object
* Remember to mention class variables
* Remember to mention instance variables
* Remember to mention global variables
* Remember to mention the singleton class
