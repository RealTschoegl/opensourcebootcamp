## Project Description
For our final project, you'll be creating a product using an Agile methodology. Agile is: 

> Agile software development is a group of software development methods based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It is a conceptual framework that promotes foreseen tight interactions throughout the development cycle.

This development process is very similar to the one that you can expect to use in your future workplace.  Most companies nowadays use some sort of version of Agile or a narrower subtype of Agile.  Take a look below at the steps in the process:

### Ideation

Brainstorm a body of ideas on spaces that you might want to address.  Then clarify and condense those ideas.  Evaluate and edit those ideas.  Now you generate ideas for those spaces.  Then clarify and condense those ideas.  Evaluate and edit those ideas.  Now generate possible solutions for those spaces.  Then clarify and condense those possible solutions.  Then evaluate and edit those solutions.

### Planning

Once you have your idea, it's time to plan how to make the thing.  This means coming up with:

1. User scenarios.  Who do you anticipate using the app?  What are the problems/pain points that they experience?
2. User cases.  How will they use the app?  What features will they need?

One you have a clear idea of what features you need to build, you can decide on what you need to build.  The next topic is then feasibility: how to execute in the time given with the resources available. Each day you will decide with your partner(s) on what task(s) you will each complete that day.  Keep these in mind:

* Each sprint must have a goal
* Stay focused on the goal / top stories
* Make sure daily goals are clear (we know the steps we need to take to achieve them)

### Sprint

This is the part where you execute your plans and write some code.  Here are some guiding Agile principles to keep in mind as you code:

* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

### Demo

You will demo the product to the class and get their feedback on what you have built and how it can be improved.  If you have something that they can try out, so much the better.  Some notes on effective criticism:

1. Have Clear Objectives
2. Create a Neutral Environment
3. Use Fewer Words With More Meaning
4. Align the Criticism With the Subjectâ€™s Goals
5. Encourage Self-Critique

### Iterate

This is a combination of a number of the steps listed above:

* Plan about how to change the product based on user feedback.
* Make those changes quickly and demo it frequently to ensure it works.
* Push the code for your project to production - in this case, to a Heroku app.

### Retrospective

Discuss what went right and what went wrong.

## Parameters

1. You'll pair with a partner for the duration of the project.  You will be able to choose the partner that you work with.
2. The first ideation and planning session will be on Monday afternoon.  After that, you will work for three days on the project.  On Friday of the first week, you will demo the application you have built to the class. You will then take their suggestions on the next Monday and begin planning/ideating how to improve what you have worked on.  You will then demo the completed application on that Thursday afternoon.   
3. The application can be a Ruby on Rails application, but does not have to be.  If you would prefer to focus on another language or framework, feel free.
4. You can pick any idea for the application that appeals to you, but it must be possible to finish an MVP (minimum-viable-product) by the Thursday deadline.
