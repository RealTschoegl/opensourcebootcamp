## Review

Review from [Weeks 10 : Lesson 4 : Unit Testing]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-05-08-lesson-unit-testing %}).  One (or more) pair will rehash the previous session's lesson by teaching the basic learnings to the group.  They will explain it to the others by drawing a diagram, using an analogy, telling a story or in some other way creatively communicating the idea without using code.

## Today's Project

Part of [Weeks 10 : Project 1 : Online store]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-05-09-project-online-store %}).

## Integration Testing

### _What Is It?_

Integration testing (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing.
